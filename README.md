# Biboo

Procedural pixel-art pipeline for a 12-frame greatsword swing in a sunset side-scroller scene.
One command rebuilds everything: the tileable background layers, the character sprite frames,
the effect overlays, a scene manifest for a game engine, and the preview GIFs.

![swing](docs/swing_x3.gif)

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.10 or newer.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m swingkit
```

Output goes to `out/` (ignored by git). Build time is a few seconds. The command also runs the
consistency checks and exits non-zero if any fail.

Options:

```
python -m swingkit --out build/          # different output folder
python -m swingkit --scales 5 3 1        # GIF scales to write (5x = 1920x1080)
python -m swingkit --no-check            # skip the checks
```

Run the checks as tests:

```
pip install pytest
pytest
```

## Output

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `swing_x3.gif`, `swing_x1.gif` | The looping animation, exact palette, no dithering |
| `frames/` | The 12 composited frames, 384x216 |
| `layers/` | `sky`, `mountains_far`, `mountains_near`, `trees_back`, `trees_front`, `ground`, `fringe`. Each is 384 wide and tiles seamlessly in x, with 8 margin rows above and below the view for camera shake |
| `character/` | 12 transparent sprite frames sharing one crop box and anchor, plus `char_sheet.png` |
| `fx_back/`, `fx_front/` | Per-frame effect overlays (smears behind the character; glint, flash, dust, debris in front) |
| `scene_manifest.json` | Layer order and parallax factors, ground line, sprite anchor, per-frame timing, sword angle and camera shake |
| `contact_sheet.png` | All frames at a glance |

Draw order back to front: sky, mountains_far, mountains_near, trees_back, trees_front, ground,
fx_back, character, fx_front, fringe. The fringe (tall grass) sits in front of the character's feet.

## The animation

Everything is drawn at one pixel scale. Limbs and the sword are redrawn every frame from fixed
measurements, never scaled, so proportions stay identical.

| Frame | Name | ms | What happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ready | 320 | Original design pose, two hands, blade forward, both feet planted |
| 2 | dip | 80 | Down before up: knees bend, blade dips below the ready line |
| 3 | rise1 | 90 | Both hands lift the blade; weight rocks back onto the rear leg, body leans back |
| 4 | rise2 | 80 | Near hand lets go to a guard fist; front foot lifts; eyes look up at the blade |
| 5 | peak | 250 | One-handed high guard, blade over the head, glint; front foot 3 px up, far shoulder lifted |
| 6 | smearA | 50 | Hands rejoin, smear over the top; rear heel lifts onto the toe, front foot travels |
| 7 | smearB | 40 | Body drops and leans into the strike; near shoulder drives down; hair and hem lift |
| 8 | impact | 110 | Blade buried, front foot stomps 4 px forward, knees bent, sleeves squash, flash, dirt, shake |
| 9-10 | plume1, settle | 90, 120 | Dust plume and debris; body overshoots 1 px lower, skirt bounces, hair swings and settles |
| 11-12 | recover1, recover2 | 110, 130 | Blade pulled free, front foot steps back, ease into frame 1 |

Techniques: the fast part of the swing is carried by smear frames instead of in-between poses;
hands never go above head height (the sword provides the height). Legs are two fixed-length
segments solved by inverse kinematics, so the hips can drop and the knees bend without changing
leg length; the front foot steps and stomps while planted feet are checked to stay on the ground.
The torso leans row by row while the head moves as one rigid piece (the face is never sheared).
The skirt hem lifts, trails, flares and bounces; the long hair sways and lifts with lag. Debris and
dust use simple deterministic physics; camera shake moves distant layers less.

Per-frame motion tables live in `swingkit/anim.py`: `HIPS` (hip offset and lean), `FEET` (front
foot), `REAR_HEEL_UP`, `CLOTH` (skirt hem), `HAIR` (sway and lift), `GAZE` (eye direction) and
`SHOULDERS` (shoulder drive and sleeve squash). Frames are always looked up by name
(`anim.by_name`), never by index. Each boot foot is drawn together with its shin as one shape
(`rig._foot_mask`), so the ankle is continuous; both feet point toward the strike.

## Changing things

- Poses and timing: edit `FRAMES` in `swingkit/anim.py`. Each frame sets the sword angle, hand
  positions, arm routing, body offsets, hair sway, draw order and duration. The checks flag arm
  lengths outside the design range and any arm or sword pixel over the face.
- Effects: particle counts, speeds, gravity and colours are at the top of the particle section in
  `swingkit/fx.py`. All randomness is seeded, so builds are reproducible.
- Scene: peak positions, colours and seeds live in `swingkit/bg.py`. Placement of the character in
  the demo scene is `X0, Y0` in `swingkit/fx.py`.

## Background art

The scene is original pixel art generated by `bg.py`. It was inspired by a reference image that was
a watermarked stock preview, which is not used or included. If you license a background of your
own, replace the files in `out/layers/` (or change `bg.build_all`) and keep the same layer names,
width and margin rows.
